# Client_Server_Application
Implementation of Client Sever Application in Python including echo client server

## Goal of the Assignment: 
**Create your own client server application 
using socket programming.**

- **Part1:**
  - *Extending Echo Client/Server for network analysis:* Creation of **UDP echo client and server** application to measure *round trip time* between client and server (similar to “ping” command)
  - The client creates a UDP socket and send echo packets to server at a given interval, number of echo messages, and given packet size which is the input to the application. On reception of the packet, server should send the packet back to the client.
